The timeline event "Started Computer Engineering" was replaced with "Developed a smart Shopping Trolley" as per your previous instruction to change "IoT programm to Developed a smart Shopping Trolley with Real-Time Customer Following and intergrated billing features".

If you would like to have "Started Computer Engineering" back in the timeline, please let me know, and I can add it as a new separate event or modify an existing one.
